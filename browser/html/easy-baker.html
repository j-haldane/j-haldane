    <p>
      Baking in blender is a really useful way to turn a UV map that <strong>looks</strong> good but is in reality a total
      mess of overlapping UVs into something that looks good and is efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately baking is a time-consuming sequence of setting up shading nodes, texture
      slots, making sure everything is selected correctly, setting up the bake job correctly, etc...
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/danielenger/Principled-Baker">Principled Baker</a> is a blender addon that addresses this. I have some issues with it:
      <ul>
        <li>It doesn't actually seem to work any more (at least on my version of Blender). I had to make 3-4 edits to the codebase to make it work.</li>
        <li>Due to the rendering passes used for Cycles, Albedos are signicantly darker after being baked.</li>
        <li>There's little control over how the mesh is unwrapped. You can only use techniques like Smart UV Project.</li>
        <li>There are a lot of features that I will never use for my workflow.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote my own addon to speed up the baking workflow:
      <ol>
        <li>Create your mesh and texture it. Eyeball the UVs to make it look nice. You can even use multiple materials! You will end up with a mesh that looks right, but with messy UVs:</li>
        <img src="/img/easy-baker/messy-uv.jpg"/>
        <li>Click "Prepare Unwrap". This puts your mesh into a state where you can immediately start unwrapping it using whichever techniques you like.</li>
        <img src="/img/easy-baker/unwrap.jpg"/>
        <li>When you're happy with your seams, click "Reapply and Bake". Profit! You now have a nice, clean Albedo with no overlap.</li>
        <img src="/img/easy-baker/clean-uv.jpg"/>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>It currently only works for Albedo. It also optionally supports alpha masking (this requires some numpy magic since the bake uses an Emission pass to avoid the aforementioned Albedo darkening issues).</p>
