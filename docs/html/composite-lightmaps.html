    <p>A gameplay concept I was toying with required dynamic light and shadow. Light needed to be dynamic so the player could extinguish light sources and hide in shadows.</p>
    <p>
      Working in Unity there are a few options for lighting scenes. There are pixel lights, which support casting realtime shadows.
      However, they're quite expensive and in my opinion do not look nearly as good as baked lights, especially when applied to low-poly assets.
    </p>
      <p>
      With Unity baked lighting, however, all lights are baked in one shot. This presents a problem with changing lighting at runtime. When you bake lights in Unity, information on how an individual light contributes to its lightmap is lost. We only get the final product: the scene lighting is static.
      To get around this (short of rewriting how Unity handles Global Illumination), I built a system using R3 Observables to create a pipeline of asynchronous bake jobs. Each bake job splits the level into logical chunks (rooms), then runs a bake job once per-light, per-room, baking only the meshes contained within it.
      Lightmap contribution is disabled for all rooms except the one being baked to reduce the number of redundant lightmaps and to speed up the baking process.</p>

    <p>For each bake, various data is recorded: which light is baking, which meshes are being baked to, the texture atlas scale/offset of each lightmap, and of course the actual rasterized lightmap textures resulting from the bake.
    A composite lighting shader was cooked up to iterate over an array of lightmaps, lightmap offsets and colors and multiply them out to get a finished composition of each light and its contribution.</p>
    <p>Finally, at runtime, we track the state of lights in the level with a script. If the light is dirtied (e.g. enabled, disabled, intensity change, color change), we resend an array of colors to the shader so it can update accordingly.</p>
